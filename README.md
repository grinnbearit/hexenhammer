# Hexenhammer
A Clojure library designed to simulate Warhammer Fantasy Battles projected onto a 3:1 scale hex grid

---
Hexenhammer is an attempt to translate Warhammer Fantasy Battles, specifically the Warhammer Armies Project ruleset into a Hex and Counters game.

Additionally, this repository contains a work in progress digital implementation of that game, a digital boardgame.

The [wiki](https://github.com/grinnbearit/hexenhammer/wiki) contains a 'dev diary' detailing my implementation. 

Do take a look if you're interested in that sory of thing. Feedback is always appreciated ðŸ˜Š
